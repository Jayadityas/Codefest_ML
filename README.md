#Project Overview
This project focuses on solving a binary classification problem where the goal is to predict the Target variable using a given dataset. The dataset consists of various categorical and numerical features, and the challenge is to develop a robust machine learning model that achieves high accuracy.

To accomplish this, the project follows a structured workflow that includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

 Project Workflow
1Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Checked missing values and handled them appropriately.
Visualized feature distributions to understand data trends.
Identified outliers and negative values and corrected them.
Performed correlation analysis to remove redundant features.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering & Processing
Encoded categorical features using Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding.
Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler for models sensitive to scale.
Created new interaction features to enhance model learning.
Handled class imbalance (if present) using SMOTE.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training & Selection
Trained multiple models:

Logistic Regression (baseline model).
Random Forest (robust tree-based model).
XGBoost (powerful gradient boosting model).
Support Vector Machine (SVM) (works well with scaled data).
Evaluated models using:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix.
Cross-validation (StratifiedKFold) for better generalization.
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation & Selection
Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Optimized model parameters using GridSearchCV for better accuracy.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Final Prediction & Submission
Used the best-trained model to predict the Target variable on the test dataset.
Saved results in the required format (UID & Target).
Generated submission.csv for competition submission.
